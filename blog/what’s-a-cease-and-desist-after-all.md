title: Whatâ€™s a Cease and Desist After All?
---

If you went by foodnome.com looking for delicious food experiences, you were probably surprised to find that our homepage looks a little different at the moment! Foodnome is in the process of making some changes due to a cease and desist order from the Yolo County health department. This cease and desist was not based on any actual harm caused to those who ate at Foodnome events, but rather on a broken food code regulation system that limits consumer choice and prevents home chefs from practicing their craft.

Foodnome is committed to fighting injustice in the broken food code regulation system. Current food code limits legal preparation of food to industrial kitchens, creating a high bar of entry into the food economy. It is so expensive to build or rent an industrial kitchen that only people who already have high access to capital can start food businesses. Because of the way resources are distributed in our society, this high bar of entry is disproportionately harmful to women, people of color, immigrants, and disabled people.

A piece of legislation to help fix this problem is currently moving through the California state senate. Assembly Bill 626 legalizes home kitchens and creates a set of regulations for their operation. It also sets up rules for an internet service, such as Foodnome, to help home kitchens meet the regulations and operate legally. The bill has passed through committee hearings and been referred to the state senate body. We are excited by this monumental legal progress toward food justice and look forward to leading the home kitchen movement as a software as a service company.

To help, you can sign our petition and contact your representative in the state senate to tell them why AB 626 matters to you. The food revolution will be led by those who are least represented in food business ownership today: black and brown people, women, disabled people, and immigrants. We believe that disproportionately low food business ownership among these groups is not due to less great ideas, recipes, and entrepreneurs, but to a food regulation system that makes it impossible for many of us to even get started. Foodnome is committed to promoting food justice, and we are so grateful for everyone who stands beside us along the way.
