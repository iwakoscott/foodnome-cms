title: Food for Thought
---
For as long as there have been humans, we have been gathering around the hearth. But food is more than survival, with it we make friends, court lovers, and count our blessings. Memories are created over the warmth and aroma of a homemade meal.

Food has become a vehicle for the exchange of culture. It serves as a gateway for new, connections and memories. These food relationships can be used strategically to help people work together and build trust.

Even the word ‘companion’ comes from Latin and means ‘with bread’ — someone friendly with whom to share a meal. Breaking bread together is a way to remove barriers and helps us explore new cultures and build stronger relationships when we socialize. This is what makes food so special, it is at the center of all cultures and family gatherings. We have many of our biggest moments in life either preparing or sharing a meal.

We do not as often sit around a real flame anymore, but the warmth from community and the warm plate in front of us continues to burn. With Foodnome we keep this flame alive.
