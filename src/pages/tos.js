            This notice sets forth the terms and conditions under which
            Foodnome, Inc., a Delaware corporation, any features and services
            from the website foodnome.com and mobile applications (collectively
            Foodnome) provides information on this website, as well as the terms
            and conditions governing your use of this website, along with any
            additional terms and conditions that may be referenced herein or
            that are presented elsewhere on the website in relation to a
            specific service or feature. By making use of this website or being
            redirected here from another domain, you agree to be bound by the
            terms and conditions that appear hereunder. The terms and conditions
            are subject to updating at any time without notice and such changes,
            additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon posting.
            We may terminate, change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the
            website, including the availability of any features of the website,
            at any time. If at any time you do not accept the terms and
            conditions, do not access the website or any of its pages. Changes
            to the terms and conditions take effect when posted to the website.
            The Foodnome website allows home-based restaurants ("Restaurants")
            to market and offer for sale meals for dine in, delivery, and/or
            pick up and customers to search for and purchase such meals. You
            should closely review the information concerning the Restaurants to
            ensure you are able to properly utilize and benefit from the
            Foodnome services. The Restaurants are obligated by Foodnome to
            comply with federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, and
            standards pertaining to food preparation, sale, marketing and
            safety. However, it is critical for you to understand that Foodnome
            does not in any way independently verify the credentials,
            representations or products of Restaurants, the ingredients or the
            quality of any products, or that a Restaurant is in compliance with
            applicable laws. You must make yourself comfortable through
            information provided by Restaurants on the Foodnome website or as
            requested by you directly from the Restaurants as to the quality and
            reliability of the Restaurants, as well as to their compliance with
            applicable laws. Foodnome does not in any way guaranty the quality
            of any food or that any food complies with applicable laws. In
            addition, a Restaurant may represent that food preparation is in
            accordance with special standards such as "organic," "kosher,"
            "macrobiotic" or allergen-specific standards such as "nut-free,"
            "gluten-free," or "lactose-free." However, Foodnome does not
            independently investigate or verify such representations. Foodnome
            shall not be liable or responsible for any food or services offered
            by Restaurants that is unhealthy, is the cause of injury, that is
            otherwise unacceptable to buyers or that does not meet the
            expectation of buyers in any manner. You are solely responsible for
            verifying the accuracy of delivery addresses, and Foodnome shall
            have no liability or responsibility for any such erroneous
            addresses.

            credit card as a method of payment, you agree that you must be
            authorized to use the credit card presented as a method of payment.
            Prior to the purchase of any goods or services on our website, you
            must provide us with a valid credit card number information and
            associated payment information, including, but not limited to, the
            following: (i) your name as it appears on the card, (ii) your credit
            card number, (iii) the credit card type, (iv) the date of expiration
            and (v) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card.
            If Foodnome does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or
            its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by Foodnome
            or its agents. The final charges on your credit card may be
            different than those stated on the website. Each customer shall be
            solely responsible for all sales taxes, or other taxes, customs,
            import/export charges, or similar governmental charges, if any.
            Foodnome does not collect sales or use taxes in all states. For
            states imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase is subject to use
            tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Your purchase is
            not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet or by other
            remote means. Many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax
            return at the end of the year reporting all of the taxable purchases
            that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. Details of
            how to file these returns may be found at the websites of your
            respective taxing authorities. Without limiting other remedies,
            Foodnome reserves the right to charge a late fee on all past due
            payments equivalent to the lesser of one and a half percent (1.5%)
            per month on the unpaid balance or the highest rate allowed by law.
            You will pay for all collection costs, attorneys fees, and court
            costs incurred in the collection of past due amounts.

          <DialogTitle>Order Acceptance Policy</DialogTitle>
          <DialogContentText>
            Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation
            does not signify Foodnome acceptance of your order, nor does it
            constitute confirmation of Foodnome offer to sell. Foodnome reserves
            the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or
            decline your order for any reason. Foodnome reserves the right at
            any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you,
            to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. Foodnome
            may require additional verifications or information before accepting
            any order. Your order is not accepted until Foodnome sends you a
            receipt and/or pick-up information for the order (or the accepted
            portion thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that, if
            Foodnome cancels all or a portion of your order or if Foodnome
            provides you less than the quantity you ordered, your sole and
            exclusive remedy is either (a) Foodnome will issue a credit to your
            credit card account in the amount charged for the cancelled portion
            or the quantity not provided (if your credit card has already been
            charged for the order) or (b) Foodnome will not charge your credit
            card for the cancelled portion of the order or the quantity not
            provided.
